# A2L
This repository holds a project that aimed to expose the 2023 cohort of the Access to Leeds (A2L) programme to coding in an academic light. The students were not expected to have broad coding knowledge and skills. Hence, the project required only salient use of HTML and CSS. Nevertheless, the following were looked out for in the works of the students:
* capabilities in a piece of independent work related to computer science.
* the ability to apply relevant study skills to an original piece of work​.
* motivation to study computer science at degree level and the skills required to do so.
* the ability to follow project specifications (against personal biases) when provided in an academic work and by a client in the industry.
* the ability to apply best practices in a coding/programming project.
* increased confidence in discussing related subject matter with an academic tutor​.
* understanding of the format of submission, assessment and feedback for an assignment at university​.
